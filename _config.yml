  Hi, my name's Lais and Iâ€™m a 3rd year IT student in CCT Colege Dublin 
  that fell in love with Python after struggling with Wolfran for 2 years 
  trying to understand advanced calculus. I used to design water dams for least-privileged
  communities in Brazil, before moving to Ireland. With 6 years of experience with customer service,
  I am currently training as a Remote Conference Operator with projects throughout the tech community
  such as Pyjamas and Python Ireland. Aiming to become a DevRel in the nebar future.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Customer Service</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>
