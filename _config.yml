  Hi, Iâ€™m a 3rd year IT student at CCT College Dublin that fell in love with Python after struggling 
  with Wolfram for 2 years trying to understand advanced calculus. I used to design water dams for the least-privileged
  communities in Brazil, prior of my move to Ireland. With 6 years of experience with customer service,
  I am currently training as a Remote Conference Operator with projects throughout the tech community, 
  such as Pyjamas and EuroPython.

I am most skilled in: <mark>Customer Service</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>
