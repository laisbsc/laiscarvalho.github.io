    During my time at CCT, I had the chance to collaborate with the students and faculty towards a more participant class experience. The group project module, present on 3rd year, also allowed me to work on soft skills such as teamwork and time-management0. I thoroughly enjoy my time in college and continue to learn a lot from it.

    The year studying in TCD allowed me to use MatLab to simulate thermodynamics problems as well as plot graphs
    to analyse mathematical equations. This opportunity also allowed me to engage on a self-driving buggy project 
    using an Arduino board and sensors such as XBee and Ultrasonic to direct it. The mini-car had its circuit-
    board manufactured from scratch, and it was configured using C# programming language.
    
    On my free time, I was also a member of The Phil and The Hist debating societies as well as the Dublin University Photography
    Association (DUPA).
