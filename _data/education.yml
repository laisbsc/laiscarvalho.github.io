    During my time at CCT I had the chance to collaborate imensily with the students and faculty
    towards a more participant class experience. The group project module, present on 3rd year also
    allowed me to work on soft skills such as teamwork and self-control under tight deadlines. I thouroughly
      enjoy my time in college and continue to earn a lot from it.

    The year studying in TCD allowed me to use MatLab to simulate thermodynamics problems as well as plot graphs
    to analyse mathematical equations. This opportunity also alowed me to engage on a self-driving buggy project 
    using an Arduino board and sensors such as XBee and Ultrasonic to direct it. The mini-car had it's circuit 
    board manufactured from scratch and it was programmed using mostly C# language.
    
    On my free time, I was also a member of The Phil and The Hist debating societies as well as the Dublin University Photograhy
    Association (DUPA).
