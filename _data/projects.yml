    ICare is a chatbot that helps people overcome loneliness. A Facebook messaging platform that uses a sentiment-analysis model to be a good ‘listener’
     and offer support on those harsh moments in life or when your friends are too busy.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The chatbot originally used Facebook Messenger’s built-in <mark>NLP</mark> to extract entities from people’s ‘emotive messages’ and classify them as either sad or happy.
    This was not suitable for our model so we decided to  use <mark>Flask</mark> to build an application that will use a modelling tool for sentiment discovery and emotion
     classification to analyse the user’s input sentences and suggest an emotion such as anger, fear, joy, etc. that would output an appropriate response to the user and act as a 'friend'.
